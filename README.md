# DEEP-Learning-Object-Detection-Using_YOLO

This repository contains an implementation of object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. The project leverages pre-trained YOLO models to detect and classify objects in images and videos efficiently.

**Features**

Real-time object detection using YOLO.

Pre-trained weights for quick setup.

Visualization of detection results.

Easy-to-follow code in a Jupyter Notebook.

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.7+

Jupyter Notebook

**Libraries:** TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

Ensure you have these installed. You can install the necessary Python packages using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

**How to Use**

**Clone this repository:**

git clone https://github.com/manangadhiya77/DEEP-Learning-Object-Detection-Using_YOLO.git
cd your-repo-name

Download the pre-trained YOLO weights and configuration files from the official YOLO website or other trusted sources.

Open the Jupyter Notebook (0bjectdetection_Using_YOLO.ipynb) in your preferred environment:

**jupyter notebook 0bjectdetection_Using_YOLO.ipynb**

Follow the steps in the notebook to load the YOLO model, process images or videos, and visualize the results.
